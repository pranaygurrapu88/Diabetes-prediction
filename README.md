# Diabetes-prediction

The objective of the project is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements include in the dataset. All the patient in the dataset are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. 

Applied various machine learning techniques by deploying Python to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. The best model was of SVM algorithm (Classification) to identify presence of diabetes. I predicted the model accuracy of the algorithm is 85%.
